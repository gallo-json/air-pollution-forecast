# Reflection 

## Date

10th grade, 2021. From Feburary to April, mostly. After those days it was just bug squashing and perfectioning. 

This was the topic for a video competition. I didn't have time to edit the video to the fullest because I was so preoccupied with finishing this project on time. But I still won a prize.

## Overview

I chose a LSTM model at first because, as the name implies, the model would take care of the long-term and short-term trends. The short-term trend in this scenario would be the fluctuation in AQI levels on the daily. For example, AQI levels during the week may be higher due to car pollution commuting to work, compared to AQI levels during the weekends. The long-term trend would be the gradual increase in AQI due to global warming. A model that takes into consideration both perspecitves would be ideal. But in the end, I went with a GRU because it outpreformed the LSTM by a little. There wasn't that much of a difference.
